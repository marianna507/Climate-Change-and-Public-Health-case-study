This case study explores the relationship between climate change, environmental degradation, and public health through the lens of the emergence of the new malaria vector species, Anopheles stephensi, in Turkana. Investigating the interplay of these factors offers crucial insights into how shifts in climate patterns and human-induced environmental changes can create conducive conditions for the spread of vector-borne diseases, posing significant challenges to public health systems. By analyzing the emergence of Anopheles stephensi in Turkana, this study aims to elucidate the complex dynamics at play and inform targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of climate change and environmental degradation on malaria transmission in vulnerable regions.
